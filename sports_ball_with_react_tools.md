# Sports Ball with React Tools

For this assignment, your task is to build a **React JSX** user interface that cheers your favorite city's sports ball team. To get started, navigate to your locally cloned `wd-react-sports-ball` repository.

```shell
cd path/to/wd-react-sports-ball
```

And create a new Brunch application in the current directory with the [`ryansobol/with-react`](https://github.com/ryansobol/with-react) skeleton.

```shell
brunch new . --skeleton ryansobol/with-react
```

Next, copy the React code from your `sports-ball.html` solution into the newly created Brunch application structure. To watch the project for changes and launch an HTTP server, start Brunch.

**NOTE:** Press `Ctrl + C` to quit Brunch.

```shell
npm start
```

Then, open the application in your default browser.

```shell
open http://localhost:8000/
```

Once everything is working, augment the user interface with the following React JSX.

- Anchor tags
- Image tags
- List tags
- CSS classes
- Inline CSS styles
- Attribute expressions
- Child expressions

Here's an example of an augmented sports ball user interface.

## Bonus

Using your preferred ESLint rules, lint your project with the `npm run lint .` command.

## Bonus

If you haven't already, inspect and debug your solution with the React Developer Tools. Make sure you understand the user interface's component hierarchy and its state.

Then, visit [Codecademy's landing page](https://www.codecademy.com/) and, using the React Developer Tools, see what changes can you make to this user interface's props and state values that'll cause the browser window to render a different DOM hierarchy.

Then, log into your [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) account, if you have one, and see if you can figure out which component hierarchies are being reused on the timeline.

Finally, [pick another React application](https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/Sites-Using-React) and see what else you can uncover with your new x-ray vision.

## Bonus

Once you're satisfied, find a classmate and see if that person would like some help.
